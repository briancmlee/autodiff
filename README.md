# autodiff

A project to (attempt to) implement autodiff in OCaml, to be the backbone of a larger Torch-like library.

The goals of the project are to:
- Learn how auto-differentiation works
- Learn more advanced OCaml features (and use them to make the library nice)

I'll implement the prototypes in Python to make sure that I've got the main idea right, then I'll try to write up the actual library in OCaml.

## Todo
- [ ] Re-write Python prototype to automatically generate computational graph from ordinary functions
- [ ] Implement limited operations in OCaml (Add and Multiply)
